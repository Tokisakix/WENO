# :camel: WENO
Official PyTorch implementation of our NeurIPS 2022 paper: **[Bi-directional Weakly Supervised Knowledge Distillation for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03664)**. We propose an end-to-end weakly supervised knowledge distillation framework (**WENO**) for WSI classification, which integrates a bag classifier and an instance classifier in a knowledge distillation framework to mutually improve the performance of both classifiers. WENO is a plug-and-play framework that can be easily applied to any existing attention-based bag classification methods.
